TODOs:

1) Fix Commander Damage Buttons:
Pressing on the commander damage sometimes fails. This is because
the node is over the top of the button for commander damage. Do 
something cool with layers, or render the button lower in the 
hierarchy than the visuals (annoying bc then we have to break up the prefab's hierarchy).
Needs googling but I'm on the plane

2) Colour gradient in UI image?
We can use fill for now

3) BUG: Background hides line renderers?
